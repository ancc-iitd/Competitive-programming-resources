## [ANCC Summer of Competitive Programming Sessions](SoCP21)
A comprehensive series of lectures, practice mashups and contests on important topics organised to help you learn and master competitive programming


## [An Introduction to Competitive Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU4Qw-8wjR4)
We answer queries like 
- What is CP?
- How should one start their journey?
- Which books to follow?
- Is tourist really a god?


## [Setting up C++ environment](https://github.com/ancc-iitd/competitive-programming-resources/tree/main/setup)
We have prepared a guide with easy steps to setup c++ development environment on Windows, macOS and Linux. So now you can get started quickly and smoothly without any fuss of searching around for tutorials or setup how-to's!
